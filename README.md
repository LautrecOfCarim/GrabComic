Simple script to let you read online comics without the malware ads

Online sites that let you read comics often clutter your browser with NSFW ads, try malware attacks on your computer or both and more.

This script looks for the image pages you want to read and downloads them locally.
You still need to save the first page of each comic locally as HTML.
If the pattern mismatches, edit the script to match the new pattern.
